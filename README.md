## Getting to Know the Python math Module

The Python math module is an important feature designed to deal with mathematical operations. It comes packaged with the standard Python release and has been there from the beginning. Most of the math module’s functions are thin wrappers around the C platform’s mathematical functions. Since its underlying functions are written in CPython, the math module is efficient and conforms to the C standard.
